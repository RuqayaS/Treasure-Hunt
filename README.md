#Treasure Hunt Project

Welcome to the Treasure Hunt Project! This game is designed to provide an exciting and interactive experience where participants solve cybersecurity-related questions to navigate towards the reward.

#Overview
The Treasure Hunt Project is an engaging game where participants solve questions based on cybersecurity to navigate to the reward. Each level is accessed through QR codes placed at different locations within the university.
If a user answers a question correctly, they are navigated to the Clue_Page, which tells them where they can find the next question, i.e., the next QR code.

#Game Structure
The project contains two pathways. Two teams will compete against each other to reach the final reward. Each team has a unique pathway to ensure they do not copy each other. However, to ensure fairness, the questions are kept the same.

Once a team gets to the last question, they are redirected to the page that tells them where the reward is hidden exactly.

#How It Works
Access Levels via QR Codes:
Each level is accessed through a QR code placed at different locations in the university.
Scan the QR code using your smartphone to access the question for that level.

#Answering Questions:

Answer the cybersecurity-related question presented on the webpage.
If the answer is correct, you will be navigated to the Clue_Page.

#Finding the Next QR Code:

The Clue_Page will provide hints on where to find the next QR code.
Follow the hints to locate the next QR code and continue the hunt.

#Competing Teams:

There are two competing teams, each with a unique pathway.
The questions remain the same for both teams to ensure fairness.
Teams must not share information to maintain the competitive spirit.

#Reaching the Final Reward:

The team that successfully answers all questions and follows the clues will reach the final page.
The final page will provide the exact location of the hidden reward.
